## Overview
Many University of Hawaiʻi students have incredible musical talent but lack a simple way to connect with others who share compatible musical skills and interests. This gap means they miss out on the joy of informal jam sessions that could grow into dynamic performing groups.

### The Solution
**Jam Sesh-ion** offers a creative platform where students can easily connect and collaborate musically. Users can log in or create profiles showcasing their musical tastes, skills, and goals—whether they’re into occasional jam sessions or looking to form a serious band. Each profile can include links to YouTube videos or SoundCloud tracks, allowing students to share examples of their musicianship and find others who align with their style and vision.

## User Guide
[Details on using Jam Sesh-ion, including account creation, profile setup, and connecting with other musicians, will be added soon.]

## Community Feedback
We encourage feedback from the University of Hawaiʻi community to make Jam Sesh-ion better and more inclusive. Let us know what features you’d like to see, your experience with the app, and any other thoughts on how we can foster a thriving musical community!
